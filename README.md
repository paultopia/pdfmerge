# swiftpdf

 description of this package.


trying to figure out how to work swift 

largely following this tutorial for command line apps: https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-command-line-tool-using-the-swift-package-manager 

plus trying to get commandline pdf merging with code from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37133031/function-in-swift-to-append-a-pdf-file-to-another-pdf

oh wait, that's ios.  maybe https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit 

which is apparently in a framework called quartz, though wouldn't it be nice if it said that... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40481769/nsimages-to-pdfs-and-merge-them-in-swift

see also http://sketchytech.blogspot.com/2015/05/adventures-in-pdf-swift-and-pdfkit.html

and let's see if things work.
